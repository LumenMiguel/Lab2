		    <h1> WAYS TO GET BETTER IN BASKETBALL </h1>
		    <p> Everyone wants to be the best player on the court. It's only human to want to be better than <br>
			your opponents and help your team win. However, you can't simply will yourself to sink baskets <br>
			and dominate defensively. (Check out these basketball defense drills.) You need to practice, <br>
			train and have the right mindset to achieve your goals. Below are nine things you can do to <br>
			improve as a basketball player. </p>
			
			<h2> <p> 1. Practice Makes Perfect </h2>
					There is no magic to getting better—it takes time and repetitions. The <br>
					"10,000-Hour Rule," made famous by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers: The Secret <br>
					to Success, states that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill. <br>
					Genetics and complexity can accelerate or impair the process. For example, not <br>
					everyone can dunk, but jumping rope doesn't take 10,000 hours to master. </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 2. Quality Repetitions </h2>
					The quality of your work is more important than the quantity. This doesn't mean <br>
					you should put in less time; it means you will benefit more from a few high-quality <br>
					repetitions than from a lot of sloppy ones. High quality means you execute at game <br>
					speed, focus on technique and maintain a high level of energy, instead of going <br>
					through the motions or rushing to finish. For example, perform a shooting drill <br>
					instead of shooting around. Low-quality reps can actually hurt your game by <br>
					reinforcing poor form. They are simply a waste of time. </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 3. Focus on the Little Things </h2>
					Many players seem unconcerned about the little things—like form and footwork—but <br>
					they can make a big difference in your game. You have to make sure you have a <br>
					solid foundation, or else the little things will hurt you down the line. Alan <br>
					Stein, owner of Stronger Team, says, "The work you put in is a brick, and you <br>
					build your building brick by brick." </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 4. Discipline </h2>
					Always be disciplined. Give 100% effort during exercises and skills practice. <br>
					Don't slack off when you're tired, and never miss a workout. If you are going <br>
					to do something, don't do it halfway. </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 5. Get Out of Your Comfort Zone </h2>
					Shooting correctly is not a naturally comfortable movement. (Learn proper <br>
					shooting technique.) Playing as low as you should defensively and offensively <br>
					is not comfortable. However, as you push yourself and improve at these things, <br>
					they will get easier and you will get better. </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 6. Bring Your Own Intensity </h2>
					Players tend to be externally motivated and need a push to practice with intensity. <br>
					No matter what the drill is, you can bring your own intensity. For example, you <br>
					can push yourself to get more repetitions, or execute better without the need of <br>
					a coach. Always be focused and try your hardest, even if the drill seems boring <br>
					or slow. </p>
			
			<h2> <p> 7. Refuse to Settle </h2>
					You need to judge your work based on what you are able to do. If you can finish <br>
					a Down and Back in eight seconds, don't settle for ten seconds, even if that <br>
					is the time limit or it's enough to finish first. </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 8. Don't Cheat Yourself </h2>
					At Thunder Sports Institute, players don't slow down until they pass the finish <br>
					line; and they don't stop for another 10 to 15 feet beyond that point. When <br>
					touching a line before turning around, make sure the line is under the center of <br>
					your body. You are not working to get through the drill. You are working to get better. </p>
					
			<h2> <p> 9. Understand the Cost </h2>
					The better you want to be, the more work you need to put in. Improving your game <br>
					doesn't come overnight. It takes the same amount of work to maintain the level you <br>
					have achieved, but even more to make it to the next level. Dedication pays off, but <br>
					you have to be willing to make sacrifices to achieve your goals. </p>
